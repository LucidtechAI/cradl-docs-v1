# Using the REST API to run flows

In this guide we'll demonstrate how to use the REST API to integrate your flow into existing systems. All examples use 
the cURL command line tool, but any tool you're using that has support for making REST API calls will work similarly.

<br/>

## Prerequisites

You need to have a [Cradl AI](https://app.cradl.ai/) account and have created a flow. If you haven't, go to 
[flows](https://app.cradl.ai/flows) and create one.

<br/>

## Step 1: Acquire API credentials

Go to the [API tab](https://app.cradl.ai/appclients) in Cradl to find or create API credentials. Read 
more on how to use the credentials to make authenticated requests [here](../reference/authentication.md)

:::caution

Remember to add the Authorization header to all API requests demonstrated in this guide or the requests will fail. Read
more about how to get and add the Authorization header 
[here](../reference/authentication.md#getting-an-access-token-manually)

## Step 2: Run a flow with a document

Choose the REST API input integration on your flow by going to the flow builder in Cradl AI and locate the `workflowId` 
that will be required to run a flow.

<br/>

### Uploading a document

Next, upload the document that you want to send to the flow. In order to do that you need to create a 
document handle in the API.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/documents 
```

In the response you'll find a `documentId` and a `fileUrl` which we'll need for the next steps.

```json
{
  "documentId": "<your documentId>",
  "fileUrl": "https://files.api.cradl.ai/<your fileId>"
}
```

Upload the document from your computer to Cradl AI using the `fileUrl` from the previous step.

```bash
curl -X PUT https://files.api.cradl.ai/<your fileId> --data-binary @my-document-file.pdf
```

<br/>

### Running the flow

After successfully uploading a document to the API, you are now ready to run the flow with the `workflowId` that you 
got from the REST API integration card in the flow builder and the `documentId` from the previous step.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId>/executions --json '{"documentId": "<your documentId>"}'
```

:::info

You can give the flow run a `title` by adding a string value for the key `title` in the
POST request. 

```json
{
  "documentId": "<your documentId>",
  "title": "My flow run title"
}
```

:::

<br/>

## Step 3: Validate the document in Cradl AI

Go to the [Cradl AI Validator](https://app.cradl.ai/supervise) and validate the document by going to Tasks, 
selecting the correct flow and completing the validation task.

<br/>

## Step 4: Fetch the final result

After successfully running the flow on a document you can now get the result from the API. When you made the API call 
to `POST https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId>/executions` in step 2 , the response contained an 
`executionId`. You will need the `executionId` in addition to the `workflowId` in order to get the output from the 
flow.

The output of the flow run contains values for all the fields automatically predicted by Cradl's AI, with potential 
corrections made by a validator. You can now be sure that the extracted data is correct and use it for further 
processing.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId>/executions/<your executionId>
```

The response JSON will have a key called `output` which contains the final (validated) results.

```json
{
  "executionId": "<your executionId>",
  "output": {
    "documentId": "<your documentId>",
    "values": {
      "my_flow_field_1": "some_value_1",
      "my_flow_field_2": "some_value_2"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info

Marking the flow run as `completed` will make it easier for you to track which runs have already been processed in 
your system and which ones have not.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId>/executions/<your executionId> --json '{"status": "completed"}'
```
