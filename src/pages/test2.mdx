# CRADL Documentation
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

  You can freely remove and add `fields` from templates according to your needs, but some `fields` have a `title` that is locked ![Image](../../static/img/icons/locked.svg). They cannot be changed because model has been pre-trained on the locked `title`.

  When starting from scratch, you define and train every `field` yourself. It is the best option if your documents are dissimilar to any of the templates, but it takes more training data to get as good results as a template.
