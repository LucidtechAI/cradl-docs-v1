Creating your `AI Model` is the first step in a `Flow`. 

While creating an `AI Model` and starting to scan documents is quick and easy, getting your model to *scan well* requires careful planning, as will become clear as we progress. 

In this section we will: 
- Show you where to create a `New model`. 

- Discuss whether you should start with a new model `from scratch` or choose a `template` model that is pre-trained on a specific document type (i.e receipts, invoices, contracts, etc.).

- Discuss how flexible an `AI Model` is. For example, if your documents have a lot of variation, will one AI Model be able to scan the various documents correctly? Will extra measures be necessary?

- Show you how to define the `fields` you want to extract from your own documents.

## Create New model

From your `Flows` overview, click on <span className="utils-admonition-success">**`New Model`**</span>. You will be taken to this screen:

There are three tasks we need to complete here:

- Give the model a name.
- Choosing whether to start with a model from scratch or use a template model.
- Defining the fields we want to extract.

### Give your model a name
(Info about hwat model name is used for)

### Create a model from scratch or use a template?

First off, any model created in Cradl AI, whether from scratch or from a template, utilises Cradl's state-of-the-art base model under the hood. When you create an `AI Model`, you are working on top of the base model Cradl AI has engineered to understand documents.

So, whats the difference between starting from scratch or using a template?

## Defining fields to extract from your documents

### Data that is *nice to have* VS data that you *need*
