# Create fields to extract
The two core components of your `AI Model` are your `fields` and your model's `training`. We will address `fields` in this section. 

For every piece of information you want to extract from your documents, you create a corresponding `field`.
The amount of fields you can have are not fixed. You can start with a limited amount and introduce new fields in the future if your documents change.

A `field` consists of a `title` and a `type`. 

## Field `title`
A `field`'s `title` is yours to decide. It does not have to correspond to what you see on your documents. For example, if your documents have a total amount of 20.000 labelled as "total: 20.000", you are free to call your field's name `total`, `total amount`, `price`, or something in another language.
:::warning
Avoid changing a `field`'s `title` once you have started training your model (we will train the model in the next section of this tutorial). Changing the title of your fields after training will require you to retrain that specific field.

## Field `type`
A `field`'s `type` improves the model's performance. For example, using the `date` type instead of a `numeric` type for a date will give better results.

 ### String
  String is the most commonly used type. It is used for data containing letters or a mix of letters and numbers.

  A common usecase for strings are addresses, which you can create in one `string` field instead of making multiple fields for each line of the address:

  ### Amount
  Use the `Amount` type if your document has monetary amounts.
 <hr />
  ### Date
  Use the `Date` type if your document has dates.
 <hr />
  ### Numeric
  Numeric is used for numbers, such as quantities, numeric IDs, etc. A Numeric field does not accept letters.

  ### Line items
  Line items are used for multiline tabular data:

  ### Classification
  Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.


## Create Model, Save flow, Train model.
1. When you have finished adding your `fields`, click <span className="utils-admonition-success">**`Create model`**</span>
2. Back in your `Flows` overview, click save your Flow by clicking <span className="utils-admonition-success">**`Save`**</span> in the upright corner of the top right navigation bar.
3. In your `Flows`overview, your `AI Model` box will now have a button named <span className="utils-admonition-success">**`Train model`**</span>:
