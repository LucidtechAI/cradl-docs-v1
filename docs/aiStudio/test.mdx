</div>

<details className='custom-accordion'>
  <summary>Inspect extracted data</summary>
<p>Based on 15 training documents, the model:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Predicted 5/5 fields correctly. However, the correct value for `total_amount` is not the first, but the second likeliest prediction. This indicates that more training data is necessary. </li>
<li> ISO formats dates automatically. </li>
</ul>
