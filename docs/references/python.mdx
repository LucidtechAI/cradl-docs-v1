# Overview

## Reference

- See full reference <a href="/python-docs/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Installation
The python SDK for Cradl can be downloaded from `pip`:
```commandline
pip install lucidtech-las
```

Don't have pip? [Here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/) are instructions for installing pip.

## Getting started
After lucidtech-las is installed and you have received credentials,
you are ready to enhance your document-flow with the las client:
```python
from las import Client
client = Client()
```
If you are new to Cradl we recommend you to check out the [key concepts](/concepts/models.mdx)
for a better understanding of what is possible with Cradl.

The Python SDK is open-source, and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/LucidtechAI/las-sdk-python).
Contributions are more than welcome.
