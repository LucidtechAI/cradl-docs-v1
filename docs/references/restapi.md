## Changelog


### 2024-02-05

- Added `monthlyNumberOfProductionWorkflowMinutesUsed`, `monthlyNumberOfUserMinutesUsed` to `/organizations`
- Added `productionWorkflowMinutes`, `userMinutes` to `/plans`
- Added `startPage` to `preprocessConfig` in `/models` and `/predictions`
- Added `nextPage` to `POST /predictions` output indicating the next page in the document available for predictions, if
there are more pages in the document that have not yet been processed.

### 2023-12-14

- Added `status`, `monthlyNumberOfExecutionsCreated` and `monthlyNumberOfExecutionsAllowed` to `/workflows`. Workflows 
can either have status `development` or `production`. A workflow with `status=development` will have a low limit on how 
many executions can be started each month.
- Added `monthlyNumberOfPagePredictionsUsed`, `monthlyNumberOfPagePredictionsAllowed` and 
`monthlyNumberOfProductionWorkflowsUsed` to `/organizations`
- Now counting number of pages processed each month to determine API limits for the `POST /predictions` endpoint. Users
already subscribed to a paid plan that counts field predictions will still be billed per field prediction. They can
choose to subscribe to the new plan which counts pages instead.

### 2023-12-06

- Added `statistics` to `/models/:id`. `statistics` contains aggregated automation percentages for the fields in the
model's `fieldConfig` from the last number of days, defaulting to last 7 days.
- Added optional `statisticsLastNDays` to `GET /models/:id`. Specify a number of days between 1 and 30 to get
`statistics` from.

### 2023-12-05

- Added optional `outputFormat` to `postprocessConfig` in `POST /models`, `PATCH /models/:id` and `POST /predictions`.
Use this option to specify which structure the predictions will have. The allowed values for `outputFormat` is 
currently`v1` and `v2`
- Added optional `status` to `PATCH /workflows/:id/executions/:id`. Use this option to change status of execution from
`succeeded` to `completed` or vice versa. 
- Parameter `nextTransitionId` is now optional in `PATCH /workflows/:id/executions/:id`
- Added `GET /appClients/:id`.

### 2023-11-17

- It is now possible to set up an email address which can be used to execute workflows. JPEG, PNG, TIFF and PDF 
attachments in the email will each start en execution of the specific workflow. The configuration requires a `secretId`
which should contain API credentials to invoke `POST /workflows/:id/executions`
- Added optional `emailConfig` to `POST /workflows`
- Added optional `emailConfig` to `PATCH /workflows/:id`

### 2023-10-25

- Added `GET /models/:id/dataBundles/:id`
- Added `GET /models/:id/trainings/:id`

### 2023-10-02

- Added new endpoint `/datasets/:id/transformations`. Transformations are operations performed on all documents in a
dataset. Currently, the only supported transformation is `remove-duplicates`.
- Added `GET /datasets/:id/transformations`
- Added `POST /datasets/:id/transformations`
- Added `DELETE /datasets/:id/transformations/:id`
- Added optional `pages` to `groundTruth` for `/documents`. Specifying `pages` gives you better results when training
models.

### 2023-09-14

- Added optional query parameter `modelId` to `GET /predictions`
- Added new permission action `delegate` in `/roles` that specifies which roles can be delegated to other resources 
such as `/users` and `/appClients`. Trying to assign roles to `/users` and `/appClients` without the `delegate` 
permission action will result in a `403 Forbidden`

### 2023-09-07

- Added optional `metadata` to `/workflows`
- Removed deprecated `avatar`, `name` and `email` from `/users`

### 2023-08-25

- Added new endpoint `/roles`. Roles can be attached to `/users` and `/appClients` to limit which API resources they 
can access.
- Added `GET /roles`
- Added `GET /roles/:id`
- Added `roleIds` to `/users`
- Added `roleIds` to `/appClients`

### 2023-06-27

- Added fileserver endpoint that can be utilized to upload larger files than 4.5MB and get thumbnails and resized
images of documents. The fileserver URL is contained in the response body of `/documents` and accepts `GET` and `PUT`
operations.
- Added `fileUrl` to `/documents`. Use this URL to access the file using your Authorization token.
- `content` and `contentType` is now optional in `POST /documents`. Instead of providing `content` and `contentType`, 
you may upload the document to `fileUrl` directly without base64 encoding. The maximum document size you can upload to
the fileserver is 64MB.

### 2023-06-14

- Added optional `preprocessConfig` to `POST /predictions`. `autoRotate`, `imageQuality`, `maxPages` and `rotation` 
should now be specified as part of `preprocessConfig` instead and will be deprecated June 14th 2024.
- Added optional `pages` to `preprocessConfig` to specify which specific pages to process when invoking 
`POST /predictions`. `pages` is 0-indexed and supports negative indices for reverse indexing such that index `0`
translates to the first page of the document and `-1` to the last page of the document.
- All individual parameters in `preprocessConfig` are now optional and may be specified as needed.

### 2023-06-07

- Added new possible `status` `running-final-evaluation` for `/models/:id/trainings` which takes place after `running`
and before `succeeded`

### 2023-03-23

### 2022-12-20

- Added `warmStartConfig` to `POST /models/:id/trainings`. Use this parameter to specify which `trainingId` to continue training from.

### 2022-09-15

For a complete list of error codes see [list of error codes](/concepts/training-data.mdx#error-handling)
- Removed deprecated types `all`, `alphanum`, `alphanumext`, `letter`, `number` and `phone` in `fieldConfig` in `/models`. 
- Added type `numeric` to `fieldConfig` in `/models`

### 2022-03-31

- Increased limit of `maxLength` for fields specified in `fieldConfig` in `/models` to `512`.
- Fixed a bug causing users to not be added to organization in `POST /users`.
- Added optional `metadata` to `/users`

### 2022-03-16

- `width` and `height` is no longer required in `POST /models` and will default to `801` and `1281`.
- `maxLength` is no longer required for fields specified in `fieldConfig` in `/models`.

```json
{
  "dueDate": {
    "type": "date",
    "description": "Due date on invoice"
  },
